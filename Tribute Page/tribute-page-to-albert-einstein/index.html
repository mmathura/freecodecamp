    <p class="lead">
      Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, one of the pillars of modern physics, alongside that of quantum mechanics.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      However, he is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula, <mark><strong><em>E = mc<sup>2</sup></em></strong></mark>, which is the “world’s most famous equation”. His works have influenced physics, astronomy and philosophy. The name “Einstein”
      is often used synonymously with the word “genius”.

    <h2>Early life, eucation, marriages and children</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Born on March 14, 1879 in Ulm (Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire) to Hermann Einstein and Pauline Koch.</li>

        <li>Family moved to Munich in 1880, where his father and uncle (Jakob) founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, an electrical equipment manufacturer, based on DC current.</li>

        <li>At 5 years old, Albert attended Catholic school for elementary education in Munich for three years, then transferred at 8 years old to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now named Albert Einstein Gymnasium) for advanced primary and secondary education, until
          he left the German Empire seven years later.</li>

        <li>Due to a change in standards to the more efficient AC current, Albert’s dad sold his electrical company in Munich to pursue business opportunities in Italy, first moving to Milan and then to Pavia; in 1894, Albert later joined his family in Pavia
          after finishing his studies in Munich. During this time, he wrote a short essay, titled <em>"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field"</em>, around the age of 15</li>

        <li>Albert attended Argovian Cantonal School (Gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, between 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary school education; where upon he also renounced his German citizenship in order to avoid military service.</li>

        <li>At only 17, he enrolled in a four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at Zürich Polytechnic, which was later awarded in 1900. Albert met his future wife, Mileva Marić who enrolled during that same year. They were married in 1903.</li>

        <li>In 1904, their first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born in Bern and their second son, Eduard, was born in Zürich in 1910. In 1914 they, moved to Berlin. Mileva divorced Albert in 1919 and he remarried Elsa Löwenthal that same year; they immigrated
          to the United States in 1933.</li>
      </ul>
